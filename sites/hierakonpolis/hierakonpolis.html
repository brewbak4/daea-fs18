         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Hierakonpolis is an ancient settlement with several names and a cult center to the god Horus. In Greek the name for the site is known as Hierakonpolis which means “city of the Hawk or Falcon”, Nekhen is the name known to the Ancient Egyptians or in modern-day Arabic it is known as Kwam Al-Ahmar or Kom el-Ahmar which means “The Red Mound”. It is named this due to the red pottery sherds strewn across the entrance of the low desert, giving it the picture of a red landscape. This site is located in Upper Egypt, on the western bank of the Nile River (25°06’N, 32°46’E), north of Aswan and was one of early Egypt’s first capitals. It contains artifacts and sites that range from a number of time periods throughout Ancient Egypt's history, not limited to but including the late predynastic and early dynastic time periods. The site is associated with kingships and the formation of a unified Egyptian state. It is one of Egypt's most important archaeological sites, including very well preserved mud-brick structures, the Narmer Palette, tombs of royalty and a wide variety of fauna (introducing the idea of pet cemeteries), the earliest painted tomb and mortuary masks only known to be found at Nehken.</p>

<p>The site is split into two separate zones. The first contains the remains of the town and the temple mound of Nekhen during the Dynastic period which is located at a low mound in the floodplain. The second zone is a group of interrelated sites about 3.5 kilometers (2+ miles) across the low desert and heading westward about 2 kilometers (about 1.5 miles) into the Wadi Desert. The zone represents one of the biggest Predynastic towns that are still accessible today.
The ancient city has survived many time periods, starting from the Predynastic to the Ptolemaic Dynasty, political and environmental shifts within the nation. Through this, a reduction is seen from a national center to a provincial center and then to a ancestral shrine.

<h4>The Site as a City</h4>
<p>The site is split into two separate zones. The first contains the remains of the town and the temple mound of Nekhen during the Dynastic period which is located at a low mound in the floodplain. The second zone is a group of interrelated sites about 3.5 kilometers (2+ miles) across the low desert and heading westward about 2 kilometers (about 1.5 miles) into the Wadi Desert. The zone represents one of the biggest Predynastic towns that are still accessible today.
The ancient city has survived many time periods, starting from the Predynastic to the Ptolemaic Dynasty, political and environmental shifts within the nation. Through this, a reduction is seen from a national center to a provincial center and then to a ancestral shrine.
During its hay day, which would have been around 3700 B.C. - 3300 B.C. The largest growth of the city and population was in 3500B.C., it would have stretched 3 plus miles along the Nile River making it one of the largest urban centers in the Nile Valley. The city is classified as a regional center of power and a capital prior to the unification of Egypt. Starting from the high point of civilization we can track the population decline through the periods and why. During the Naqada I period (3100B.C.) the estimated population was about 10,000 inhabitants covering anywhere from 32 - 37 hectares of land. This is the only time that the habitation across the low desert would be seen. From Naqada IIIa-b (3500 - 3300 B.C.) we see a decline in population and movement into the floodplain due to the recession of the Nile floods as well as a return to the use of the cemetery at HK6. There is also population loss due to the formation and rise of the cities El-Kab (across the river) and Edfu (south of Nekhen). Through the unification period of Egypt, we see a slower decline of the city and the desert area is completely abandoned. There is evidence of a revival of the city under Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III during the New kingdom but it is short lived. The city now lays dormant and hasnt been inhabited since the Bardarian period (4500 - 4200B.C.). Evidence of this is shown through coring excavation at the site
Much focus of the interpretations and excavation of the area date to the Predynastic and early dynastic periods.</p>
<h5>Issues with the Site</h5>
<p>Due to the fact that excavations were done by British archaeologists, J.E. Quibell, F.W. Green, J. Garstang, and H. Jones; left information and context severely lacking. Only being able to draw from a preliminary report, letters back home and negatives which were used to piece together any reconstruction done in the area (Barta, M, 1997). The stratigraphy was done by Quibell and Green of the important sites located in Hierakonpolis were incoherent and many didn’t understand (Bussman, R, 2014). Among these issues, there is also a problem with looting of the graves and various sites across Nehken, as well as a damage to the land from modern farmers mining the area for organic-rich midden to fertilize their fields and the encroaching city to the right.
The site was filled with royal activity through the Middle Kingdom, however much of the knowledge gathered comes from archived field reports, manuscripts and objects, much of which are unpublished. During the shifts in the induction periods of the Nile River, we see shifts in elite cemeteries and population increase and decrease. For example, during Naqada IIc period we see the elite burials move to the southeastern side of the site and then again in Naqada III period we see them return to the wadi cemetery.</p>
